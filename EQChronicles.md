# Chronicles from the Best Fellowship

## A New Beginning - Yelinak Server

**May 25, 2022** - We rolled our toons, spent a moment in various newbie yards and then ventured to meet in the Commonlands tunnel.
Through the evening we took liberal advantage of the soul binding point in the tunnel to get back in the action as we all levelled to 5.  
This culminated in a multi-pull which took out Yazz, then Ichantu and Shoeless.  With the rest trying to hold against the final mob or two, 
Shoe made it back just in time to throw heals at Khadson to alternate from standing and purple.  
He bounced back and forth 6 times before the mob was turned and the group was victorious‼️


## The Only Good Orc ...

**May 26, 2022** - Everyone used their newly available Origin spells to pick up all their useful spells and get back to the meeting place in the Commonlands tunnel.
We tested the waters in North Ro, but they were too much for comfort.  Back in the Commonlands we dinged a couple folks and moved to Orc 2.  
While the initial break was owed to Yazz's kiting effort, we settled into an easy grind which gained everyone a level or 2.  We started pulling the surrounding field and then grew tired of the camp.
Moving on to Dervish the next hill over we collected a complete set of 12 rings; a pair for all.  
Finally we moved back to North Ro.  Wouldn't you know it, it was entirely too easy.  To South Ro we went.
Here we nestled in the center of 4 dervish camps where we set to a pulling frenzy!  By the end of the evening, Teggito was level 10 and the rest of us right on his heels.
We discussed Crocs on the east side of Oasis as tomorrows gathering spot.
