# Chronicles from the Best Fellowship

## /disband

**July 13, 2022** - In the week leading up to Kunark we have been grinding the harder to find items of original.  

After seeing 40+ Placeholders, Lord Begurgal popped and Bildo picked up his final preloot item for Cleric epic.  We moved to the hole and looked for Ratman Guard who spawned just as we were looking to wrap up for the night and a Dusty Tome dropped for Khadson.

While in the Hole, we also found an Idol of the Underking for Bildo so that he and Shoeless are both set.

Each of us has items which require raids and are rare in those settings to boot.  The chaotic nature of the One Last Time, the guild which had the best raid schedule for us means we haven't distinguished ourselves in their eyes when items need to Loot Council.

Tonight that proved too much for Yazz and Shoeless, so they dropped guild.

Being assigned items from a bunch of folks we met two months ago has trumped fellowship stability.  What will come next?

## Live side grind

**June 7, 2022** - Emboldened by our successes last night we headed for the King room + Castle for some xp grind.  It worked out pretty well save for one incident.

We got some pants, but that's the extent of it ... stingy mobs tonight!

## Live side, without our Enchanter

**June 6, 2022** - It was a slow crawl but we made it to the King area.  Khadson and Teggito worked to break the room and we did it, then we kept the room until the end of the night.

It would have been entirely improved with Ichantu!

## Lower Guk

**June 5, 2022** - While the group wasn't at full strength the Assassin camp was targeted and we came away with enough masks to make folks happy!  

We eventually moved to the Executioner, Sage, Savant, Cavalier camp which we out powered pretty easily, so Frenzied and Sentinel were pulled to us as well.

There were a bunch of items picked up, but the Savant was stingy with his hat!

We also ended up inviting a cleric along with us.  The alt of "Bonr" named Bluebies.  The idea of waiting for a Complete Heal to land 10 seconds later has pushed me to create a Gina trigger for Khadson to see the casts!

## Hasten Bootstrutter

**June 4, 2022** - Today was the day!  While one Ring of the Ancients was picked up earlier in the week, today we acquired the other 4 for our group.  We can finally leave the Ocean of Tears knowing that our work is done.

<img align="right" width="150" src="https://github.com/mbeamer/stoneandsteel/blob/master/EQ%20screenshots/Yelinak/jboots.jpg">

A little bit of extra effort picking up a rapier and then locating Hasten himself to complete the quest for Journeyman's Boots!  Farming Gargoyles eyes on the undead island made finding the necessary 325pp quite straight forward.

Yazz picked his surname along the way, Yazz Matazz, which pairs well with his "Big Badaboom" emote.  Watch for him when you need something burned down.

<img align="right" width="150" src="https://github.com/mbeamer/stoneandsteel/blob/master/EQ%20screenshots/Yelinak/DEIllusion.png">

We are now all upper 30s to lower 40s in level and ready for a new challenge, like illusion masks from the Assassin which Khadson found for himself.  

Being a Shadow Knight is very freeing after being a Cleric.  All the self invisibilities and if you stumble upon an open camp you can actually ponder whether you could solo it.  The answer being, 'yes, yes you can'.


## Ring of the Ancients

**June 3,2022** - Gear acquisition is becoming the name of the game as we level into the 30s.  Getting Ring of the Ancients for everyone to complete JBoots is what we settled on as a focus.

<img align="right" width="200" src="https://github.com/mbeamer/stoneandsteel/blob/master/EQ%20screenshots/Yelinak/GhoulLord.png">

The island is packed, hotly contesting the Ancient Cyclops (AC).  We keep grinding with the first ring going to Khadson in an 'oops' assignment.

Second evening at the island and Yazz suggests Khadson stick with a Lower Guk group which netted him a Dark Reever which much improves his aggro holding ability.

Through Friday Yazz crafted all sorts of upgraded gear for folks so that by Friday evening we are facing blue-yellow cons on the island where we kept it clear but the AC never spawned on our side!

Khadson was lucky enough on his first Ghoul Lord kill to win a Skull Shaped Barbute!

## Ohh, Shiny

**May 31, 2022** - I'll start with the frustration that `/assist Khadson` does not work to give Khadson's target like `/assist main` does with Khadson marked as Main Assist.  

That being the case, Bell's macros don't work while group setup isn't complete, and since folks don't want to stand around for her to buff once the macros work, I'm expecting to see little of her in group settings.

It was a short evening as we got a late start and Khadric had to run off to pick up a child from work.  What time we did get in was the 5 of us in Split Paw cracking level 30 for everyone.  

We've also taken to hanging out in the Guild Discord for voice comm to see if we can't make friends.  Tonight we had SouldBright drop in and bend our ears.  He went so far as to bestow a Shining Metalic Robe on Ichantu!  Both useful now, and as a component in her epic later... a most thoughtful gift.

We also heard tell the guild has swelled to 800 members :open_mouth:  Will be interesting to see what raids look like.

## Retraction and Correction

<img align="right" width="100" src="https://github.com/mbeamer/stoneandsteel/blob/master/EQ%20screenshots/Yelinak/Ichantu-May31-2022.png">

**May 31,2022** - Let it be known that this periodical has been contacted regarding defaming remarks about an Enchanter, "Mezing themselves".  

To correct the situation, the original article has been amended and we wish to apologize at any Enchanters who may have been slighted due to our impudence in suggesting they'd Mez themselves, rather than informing the group of a simple situation where the Enchanter may be out of commission briefly due to a Mez effect unrelated to their own spell casting.

I may have been Charmed into making this post.

## Just Ding Already

**May 30, 2022** - Needing Researched spells in the low 20s for a new server is rough business.  And the irony is that while aligning ourselves to that goal, our casters have levelled past the need for them (for now).

<img align="right" width="200" src="https://github.com/mbeamer/stoneandsteel/blob/master/EQ%20screenshots/Yelinak/Npc_a_lteth_val_scribe.png">

Before discussing it, we reconvened in Mistmoore for more of the same as last night.  Our little spot base beset on both sides by groups which left slim pickings for us.  After not too long we decided to move along and see if Paw was finally the fit we were looking for.

A Group port from Shoeless to the North Karana Druid Ring was very welcome.  A "quick" jaunt, half way across South Karana and we were at Paw.  We started with a crawl but the difficulty never ratcheted up to a comfortable level, so we headed to the Jail which started as red to everyone.

Our first encounter with the Scribe let us know just how scary this place can be.  AE Mez?  Yuck!  A pickzone that closed, a dead Shadow Knight and some creativity got us back in action.  Necromancers are so full of tricks!  (even if the cash shoppe was involved :) )

Back on track and it was still dicey.  Shoe perished a couple further times, Ichantu let's us know when she ~~mezed herself~~ was mezed - that we yet can't do anything about - and Bell learned how to target the MA's target's target to throw a heal on someone other than Khadson.

Let's not forget that all the loot is nice and being snapped up as upgrades ... we've set a plan to revisit the area tomorrow!


## And We Found A Friend

**May 29, 2022** - Our INT casters have been noticing the lack of store-buyable spells, so Yazz, Shoeless and Teggilo spent time hunting Gargoyles for their eyes. About 600pp later and Ichantu is on her way to learning research.

Later in the day all we convened in Mistmoore in order to get further components for Ichantu.  Mistmoore is altogether very out of the way, a bit higher than we might normally choose to hunt and full of trains at the same time.  So it took a while to settle in.

As we were settled and fighting our fights, a lone cleric bowled into us with a mob in toe.  We finished ours off and engaged in complaining about the impertinence of fighting a mob in our camp.  Looking closer we determined both that this Dwarf was a Cleric (hmm, useful!) and that he is part of the guild we joined up with!  Well, that was enough for Shoeless to throw heals at him and Yazz to nuke down his mob.

He agreed to join the group and we got to know Pancake a bit for the rest of the evening.  We'll see if he's around again tomorrow! 

## What . A . Session

**May 28, 2022** - It has been a long time since we marathoned like that!  With the help of an 8 hour XP potion provided by Shoeless, it ended with about 10 levels in the books for everyone.

<img align="right" width="200" src="https://github.com/mbeamer/stoneandsteel/blob/master/EQ%20screenshots/Yelinak/BraceleOfWovenGrass.png">

It began in Upper Guk where we crawled to the Scryer camp.  This camp was just the right difficulty for us and we were able to extend our reach quite a bit as time passed until, after collecting three of these for our INT casters, we pulled up roots and looked for a new challenge.

When we were ready to leave the Scryer, the 6 pick zones of Upper Guk all showed our next likely destinations as overrun with other players so we made a journey.<br><br><br><br>

<img align="right" width="400" src="https://github.com/mbeamer/stoneandsteel/blob/master/EQ%20screenshots/Yelinak/CazicMaze-Cramped.png">

And that challenge was in the maze of Cazic Thule, where it was a tight squeeze!  But again we found a good level range of baddies to exterminate to pass the time.  No loot, but plenty of exp!

<img align="left" width="200" src="https://github.com/mbeamer/stoneandsteel/blob/master/EQ%20screenshots/Yelinak/FeignDeathSuccess.png">

As we levelled we unlocked skills that would define how the group is able to carve up content.  Teggito and Khadson unlocking their halmark Feign Death which allowed us to break the Thrown Room camp in Cazic Thule later in the day.

The new group composition seems to have all the right parts and with adventures that net us loot, levels and experiences to use our toons well together the  sky is the limit.

This time around we are also aware of tools like EQ Log Parser where we can see those sweet numbers ... and crank them up!

## Making Short Work of the Croc Highway

**May 27, 2022** - Through the day, Yazz had a chance to work up some tradeskills and provide Khadson a set of leathers which are harder for the crocs to chew through.
Khadson was fiddling around with Bell's controls and tried his best to feed Yazz's habit by providing furs and meats.

Once we all got setup, the action on the highway commenced; so many crocs!  We crushed, stomped and acted casual when Lockjaw strolled past.

So many that we all completed this achievement:

> This is a Skill Slayer achievement.
> "Just remember your reptilian A-B-C's: Alligators, Basilisks, and Crocodiles!
>
> Reward:
> Your Banestrike ability now works on: Alligators, Basilisks, and Crocodiles

The Croc Highway is a lovely place from level 10-16, especially if you've brought enough of a group to handle the sheer quantity of mobs available.

We'd have stopped 45 minutes earlier, but couldn't quite settle on our next grind while the xp bonus for Memorial Day weekend was on.  We've settled on Upper Guk with Cazic Thules as a relatively close fall back.

## The Only Good Orc ...

**May 26, 2022** - Everyone used their newly available Origin spells to pick up all their useful spells and get back to the meeting place in the Commonlands tunnel.
We tested the waters in North Ro, but they were too much for comfort.  Back in the Commonlands we dinged a couple folks and moved to Orc 2.  
While the initial break was owed to Yazz's kiting effort, we settled into an easy grind which gained everyone a level or 2.  We started pulling the surrounding field and then grew tired of the camp.
Moving on to Dervish the next hill over we collected a complete set of 12 rings; a pair for all.  
Finally we moved back to North Ro.  Wouldn't you know it, it was entirely too easy.  To South Ro we went.
Here we nestled in the center of 4 dervish camps where we set to a pulling frenzy!  By the end of the evening, Teggito was level 10 and the rest of us right on his heels.
We discussed Crocs on the east side of Oasis as tomorrows gathering spot.

## A New Beginning - Yelinak Server

**May 25, 2022** - We rolled our toons, spent a moment in various newbie yards and then ventured to meet in the Commonlands tunnel.
Through the evening we took liberal advantage of the soul binding point in the tunnel to get back in the action as we all levelled to 5.  
This culminated in a multi-pull which took out Yazz, then Ichantu and Shoeless.  With the rest trying to hold against the final mob or two, 
Shoe made it back just in time to throw heals at Khadson to alternate from standing and purple.  
He bounced back and forth 6 times before the mob was turned and the group was victorious‼️
