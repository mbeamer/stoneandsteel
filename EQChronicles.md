# Chronicles from the Best Fellowship

## What . A . Session

**May 28, 2022** - It has been a long time since we marathoned like that!  With the help of an 8 hour XP potion provided by Shoeless, it ended with about 10 levels in the books for everyone.

It began in Upper Guk where we crawled to the Scryer camp.  This camp was just the right difficulty for us and we were able to extend our reach quite a bit as time passed until, after collecting three of these for our INT casters, we pulled up roots and looked for a new challenge.

When we were ready to leave the Scryer, the 6 pick zones of Upper Guk all showed our next likely destinations as overrun with other players so we made a journey.<br><br><br><br>

And that challenge was in the maze of Cazic Thule, where it was a tight squeeze!  But again we found a good level range of baddies to exterminate to pass the time.  No loot, but plenty of exp!

As we levelled we unlocked skills that would define how the group is able to carve up content.  Teggito and Khadson unlocking their halmark Feign Death which allowed us to break the Thrown Room camp in Cazic Thule later in the day.

The new group composition seems to have all the right parts and with adventures that net us loot, levels and experiences to use our toons well together the  sky is the limit.

This time around we are also aware of tools like EQ Log Parser where we can see those sweet numbers ... and crank them up!

## Making Short Work of the Croc Highway

**May 27, 2022** - Through the day, Yazz had a chance to work up some tradeskills and provide Khadson a set of leathers which are harder for the crocs to chew through.
Khadson was fiddling around with Bell's controls and tried his best to feed Yazz's habit by providing furs and meats.

Once we all got setup, the action on the highway commenced; so many crocs!  We crushed, stomped and acted casual when Lockjaw strolled past.

So many that we all completed this achievement:

> This is a Skill Slayer achievement.
> "Just remember your reptilian A-B-C's: Alligators, Basilisks, and Crocodiles!
>
> Reward:
> Your Banestrike ability now works on: Alligators, Basilisks, and Crocodiles

The Croc Highway is a lovely place from level 10-16, especially if you've brought enough of a group to handle the sheer quantity of mobs available.

We'd have stopped 45 minutes earlier, but couldn't quite settle on our next grind while the xp bonus for Memorial Day weekend was on.  We've settled on Upper Guk with Cazic Thules as a relatively close fall back.

## The Only Good Orc ...

**May 26, 2022** - Everyone used their newly available Origin spells to pick up all their useful spells and get back to the meeting place in the Commonlands tunnel.
We tested the waters in North Ro, but they were too much for comfort.  Back in the Commonlands we dinged a couple folks and moved to Orc 2.  
While the initial break was owed to Yazz's kiting effort, we settled into an easy grind which gained everyone a level or 2.  We started pulling the surrounding field and then grew tired of the camp.
Moving on to Dervish the next hill over we collected a complete set of 12 rings; a pair for all.  
Finally we moved back to North Ro.  Wouldn't you know it, it was entirely too easy.  To South Ro we went.
Here we nestled in the center of 4 dervish camps where we set to a pulling frenzy!  By the end of the evening, Teggito was level 10 and the rest of us right on his heels.
We discussed Crocs on the east side of Oasis as tomorrows gathering spot.

## A New Beginning - Yelinak Server

**May 25, 2022** - We rolled our toons, spent a moment in various newbie yards and then ventured to meet in the Commonlands tunnel.
Through the evening we took liberal advantage of the soul binding point in the tunnel to get back in the action as we all levelled to 5.  
This culminated in a multi-pull which took out Yazz, then Ichantu and Shoeless.  With the rest trying to hold against the final mob or two, 
Shoe made it back just in time to throw heals at Khadson to alternate from standing and purple.  
He bounced back and forth 6 times before the mob was turned and the group was victorious‼️
